# Hi üëã I am Sridhar Pai

Data Analytics Leader with 25+ years of experience with Digital transformation and Data Engineering fields. I have extensively worked on building analytics solutions using Oracle and Microsoft Data integration and reporting tools. I am well versed with ETL tools such as Oracle Data Integrator, Talend, Informatica, BI reporting platforms such as OracleBIEE, Tableau.  

üî≠ As freelance consultant I undertake and execute large Data Analytics projects for Fortune 500 companies.  Below are few projects that I have executed in Data Analytics and Data scence. \
**Data Analytics Projects** \
**1.OPLA Upgrade Project** : This is a Data Engineering project executed for Global Semiconductor company for the upgrade of OPLA (**Oracle Product Lifecycle Analytics**) solution and optimization of ETL Load Performance. \
**2.Upgrade and Data Migration : Cognos to Oracle Project** : This is Data Analytics project for the purpose of a) upgrade of Oracle Data Analytics platform from ODI 11g to ODI 12c and b) migration of Oil n Gas Data warehouse from Cognos to Oracle Analytics reusing existing Oracle Analytics Warehouse template. \
**3.Industrial IOT Solution for Machine Tools** : This project is envisaged for a Grinding Machine Tool Manufacturing companyto build a cloud based IOT software Solution for supporting its customers from anywhere, any time.  **Technology Stack**: Siemens 1215 PLC, Mitsubishi fx5U PLC Controllers, Microsoft SQL Server, .NET, C#, Azure Cloud, Elastic search. \
**4.Community Healthcare Analytics for Community Heatlh care provider** : This is Healthcare Analytics solution for Community Health care provider. Hosted on AWS and Heroku, Data Integration with Talend ETL Platform, 
Data Store with PostGreSQL,  Rest API Framework with Node.js, Angularjs, Security Model with Strongloop, Analytics model and Visualizations with D3.js, CD.js, Crossfilter.js. \

Also I am Data Science Developer passionate about AI, NLP, Deep learning and application of these technologies for solving real world problems. I love to work with technologies including TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Numpy, Transformers, BERT, LLMs to name a few. Please feel free to reach out to me. \

**Data Science Projects** \
**1.Unveiling Online Deception : Fake-review-detection using Deep Learning Techniques** : This is a Research thesis project done as part of my Masters in Data Science Program in Liverpool John Moore University, UK. THe main purpose of this research is to assess the effectiveness of different Embedding Techniques such as BERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT, XLNET and machine learning algorithms, including **Support Vector Machine, Na√Øve-Bayes, and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), LSTM, BERT (transformer)**. This utilizes various ML and DL libraries such as TensorFlow, SKLearn, Keras, Pandas. etc. \
**2.Creditcard Fraud Detection Project** : This project is to build solution to cater to Credit Card Fraud detection. This will detect fraudelent transactions, when card member swipes their card for payment, the transaction is classified as fraudulent or authentic based on a set of predefined rules. If fraud is detected, then the transaction must be declined. Incorrectly classifying a transaction as fraudulent will incur huge losses to the company and also provoke negative consumer sentiment. **Technolog Stack:** Python, HDFS, Hbase, Kafka, PySpark Streaming, Scoop Data Ingestion. \
**3.Retail_data_analysis**: This is case study project with Kafka, Pyspark, HDFS. \
**4.Bank_ETL_Project** : The overall task in this project will be to build a batch ETL pipeline to read transactional data from **RDS**, transform and load it into target dimensions and facts on **Redshift Data Mart**(Schema). Spar Nord Bank has built a dimensional model datastore (ATM Data Mart) on ATM transaction data to understand the ATM usage pattern. \
**5.Lead-Score-Case-Study**: This project is to Build a **Logistic regression model** to assign a lead score between 0 and 100 to each of the leads which can be used by the company to target potential leads so that it can use to improve \
**6.RSVP_Movie_Casestudy** : This project is about using **SQL based** analytical insights to the decision making. RSVP Movies is an Indian film production company which has produced many super-hit movies. They have usually released movies for the Indian audience but for their next project, they are planning to release a movie for the global audience in 2022. The production company wants to plan their every move analytically based on data This project is to analyse the data set and draw meaningful insights that can help them start their new project. \
